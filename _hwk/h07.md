Read Chapter 6, Chapter 9, sections 9.1-9.2 (pages 508 - 533). The key learning goals are dynamic memory allocation and its use in dynamic arrays and linked-lists. You don't need to turn this homework in. To earn credit for this homework, complete the corresponding quiz on gauchospace AFTER you have completed the pen and pencil version of the homework. The quiz will be available at least one day before the due date indicated on the homework.

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL! FOR BEST RESULTS, SAVE THIS PAGE AS A PDF, THEN PRINT THE PDF.</b>

1.(10 pts) What is the output of the following program? Using a pointer diagram show the evolution of all data objects in memory, clearly marking elements on the run-time stack and on the heap. Mark the size of all data objects. Assume the code is embedded in a correct and complete program.
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int *p1, *p2, *p3;
p1 = new int;
p2 = new int;
p3 = p1;
*p1 = 20;
*p2 = 30;
cout<< *p1<< " "<< *p2<<" "<<*p3<< endl;
p1 = p2;
cout<< *p1<< " "<< *p2<<" "<<*p3<< endl;
*p3 = *p2;
cout<< *p1<< " "<< *p2<<" "<<*p3<< endl;
```

2.(10 pts) What is the output of the following program? Using a pointer diagram show the evolution of all data objects in memory, clearly marking elements on the run-time stack and on the heap. Mark the size of all data objects. Assume the code is embedded in a correct and complete program.
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int array_size = 4, *a ;
a = new int[array_size];
int *p = a;
for(int i=0; i< array_size; i++)
    *(a+i) = 2*i;
p[0] = 10;
for(int i=0; i< array_size; i++)
    cout<<a[i]<<" ";
cout<<endl;
```

3.(10 pts) Write the definition of a structure type called UndergradStudents. This structure should contain student ID numbers, first and last names, major, and GPA scores for each undergraduate year.
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

4.(20 pts) Write a program that uses the definition of the structure UndergradStudents from the previous question to *declare* and then *initialize* an array of 3 objects of this structure (hint: you can do this with the same approach you define/initialize an array of any other type). You **must initialize the values in the program, not by user input**.  The initial values are shown in the table below. Then write the definition of a function with the signature <code> void printRecords(UndergradStudents *records, int numrecords);</code> The function should print out the values of the array of objects passed to it as shown in the sample below, along with each student's AVERAGE GPA score (calculated to a precision of 2 decimal places). You **must use a loop to print the output**. Your program should appropriately call the printRecords() function to print the student records and the average GPA.

<div markdown="1">
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
|ID | First name| Last Name| Major | GPA Yr1|  GPA Yr2| GPA Yr3| GPA Yr4
|1 | Joe | Shmoe | EE | 3.8 | 3.3 | 3.4 | 3.9
|2 | Macy | Chen | CS | 3.9 | 3.9 | 4.0 | 4.0
|3 | Peter | Patrick | ME | 3.8 | 3.0 | 2.4 | 1.9

OUTPUT:

```
These are the student records:
ID# 1, Shmoe, Joe, Major: EE, Average GPA: 3.60
ID# 2, Chen, Macy, Major: CS, Average GPA: 3.95
ID# 3, Peter, Patrick, Major: ME, Average GPA: 2.77
```
