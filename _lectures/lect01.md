# Getting a terminal on your computer (you need to get this working before your lab on Monday)

Using a Mac: <https://youtu.be/OfYG6WxlXes>

Using Virtualbox (Windows or Mac): <https://youtu.be/M5yzMPNZMCw>. I had some trouble getting shared folders working properly, but just watch until the very end and it'll all work out!

Come to my office hours if you have any trouble. All the notes that I write are available for you to view using the "whiteboard notes" link on the homepage.
